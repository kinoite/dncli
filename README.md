# dncli
dncli ("**d**ow**n**load client") is a download client, like wget, written in Rust.

The aim of dncli is to be more performant, faster and reliable, Unlike wget, it still relies on Rust dependencies that need to be installed thru cargo, Rust's package manager, dncli will hopefully become fully independent from those dependencies soon enough (no offence).
